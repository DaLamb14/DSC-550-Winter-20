The first is polarity, meaning the positivity or negativity of the statement. This measurement ranges from -1, which is very negative, to 1, which is very positive. This means a neutral statement lies at 0. The second measurement displayed is the subjectivity of the statement, meaning the persons emotion, judgement, or opinion in the sentence. This measurement is from 0 to 1 with 1 being the highest amount of subjectivity and 0 being no subjectivity. "

    "With this set I removed most of the columns, keeping the names of the reviewers and the comments. From here, I applied the TextBlob analysis to each entry, adding a column for polarity and subjectivity to create a cleaner description of the results than the original problem above. I decided to take a sample of 100 from this set so that the dataframe was not terribly long. I found from this that the TextBlob funtion cannot decipher languages not using the Roman Alphabet. In addition, the overall mood of the comments was fairly positive, with a polarity mean of 0.46. the subjectivity was also high, which makes sense since these are reviews of airbnb locations. "
